<title>European Symposium on Programming (ESOP)</title>
<section>
<title>
The conference
</title>
<p>
ESOP is a member conference of the <a href="http://etaps.org/">European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software</a> (ETAPS), which is the primary European forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics relating to Software Science.
</p> 
<p>
ESOP is devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design,
analysis, and implementation of programming languages and
systems. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming
language research including, but not limited to, the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Programming paradigms and styles: functional programming, object-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, logic programming, constraint programming, extensible programming languages, domain-specific languages, synchronous and real-time programming languages;</li>
    <li>Methods and tools to write and specify programs and languages: programming techniques, logical foundations, denotational semantics, operational semantics, meta programming, module systems, language-based security;</li>
    <li>
    Methods and tools for reasoning about programs: type systems, abstract interpretation, program verification, testing;</li>
    <li>
    Methods and tools for implementation: program transformations, rewriting systems, partial evaluation, experimental evaluations, virtual machines, intermediate languages, run-time environments;</li>
    <li>
    Concurrency and distribution: process algebras, concurrency theory, parallel programming, service-oriented computing, distributed and mobile languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome.
</p>

  <title>Submission Guidelines</title>
<p>
Papers must be written in English, unpublished and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. The proceedings are published with  Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
Submissions must be in PDF format, formatted in the LNCS style and be
at most 25 pages long. A bibliography of up to two pages may be
added. Additional material intended for the reviewers, but not for
publication in the final version may be placed in a clearly marked appendix.
Papers violating these constraints are rejected without review.

<title>ESOP Collected Papers in TOPLAS</title>
<p>
ESOP has an agreement with <a href="http://toplas.acm.org">ACM
Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems</a> to produce an
issue of the journal collecting selected papers of the conference. The
PC Chair of ESOP has the task to determine whether among the accepted
papers there are enough of them that would match both the <a
href="http://toplas.acm.org/authors.cfm#acceptance-criteria">acceptance criteria</a> and the <a
href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions">prior
publication policy</a> of TOPLAS. In January, the authors of the
selected papers will be invited to prepare a revised and expanded
version of their work to be submitted to TOPLAS right after the
conference.  In order to ensure rapid decision and, in case of
acceptance, timely publication, the PC Chair of ESOP will forward  the reviews of the papers to
TOPLAS. The papers will follow the normal
TOPLAS reviewing process but TOPLAS will grant them a speedier
treatment so that the composition of the TOPLAS issue will be known
before the next ESOP edition. It will be announced on its website.

<title>Steering Committee</title>
<p>
The Steering Committee (SC) is formed by six members: three permanent
members, including the SC Chair, elected for at most six years by the
steering committee itself; three rotating members, formed by the
Program Committee (PC) Chairs of the previous, current, and next
editions of ESOP. In case of several co-chairs they will count
collectively as a single member. In case one of the permanent members
is also a rotating member then the PC Chair of the two editions before
sits in the SC.
</p>
<p>
  The SC must perform essentially three tasks:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Select the PC Chairs of the <i>(n+2)</i>-th edition right after the <i>n</i>-th edition of ECOOP. </li>
<li> Elect new permanent members and SC Chair to replace members whose
mandate has ended. </li>
<li> Ensure the quality and criteria of the selection process over the different editions.</li>
</ol>
The current composition of the Steering Committee is
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal">Amal Ahmed</a> (PC Chair 2018)</li>
<li> <a href="http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/~lcaires/">Luis Caires</a> (PC Chair 2019)</li>

</ul>
  The Steering Committee of ESOP was created in 1998, when the ETAPS
  cluster was created with ESOP as one of the key conference.  Before
  that ESOP was a biannual conference and was looked after by <link
  href="http://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/wilhelm.shtml" noicon="true">Reinhard
  Wilhelm</link>, one of the founding fathers of ESOP. Since its creation the ESOP Steering Committee was chaired by:

<title>Program Committee Chair</title>
<p>
The Program Committee (PC) Chair is responsible for selecting the
members of the PC, organizing the selection process, and preparing the
final program and the proceedings.  The PC Chair has great latitude in
organizing her/his tasks. However, since ESOP is part of ETAPS, the PC
Chair must abide some common rules. In particular she/he:
</p>
<ul>
<li>must propose to the ETAPS Steering Committee the composition of
the Program Committee and some substitute members <i>before</i>
contacting them. This is necessary to let the ETAPS SC verify whether
there is any overlap on the PC's of the six main conferences composing
ETAPS.</li>
<li>must <i>strictly</i> adhere to the deadlines set by the ETAPS
Steering Committee. In particular she/he must not extend the
submission, rebuttal and final version deadlines, and must strictly
respect the dates of notification and the dates for sending to the ETAPS SC the proposals
of PC members, invited speaker, and paper nominations (see below).</li>
<li>must enforce the ETAPS multiple submission policy</li>
<li>must comply with the decision of the ETAPS SC Chair on the maximum
number of accepted papers (usually the minimum between 33% of the
submissions and the number of slots available for the conference).</li>
<li>must choose with the PC an invited speaker for ESOP</li>
<li>must decide with her/his Program Committee whether among the accepted papers there enough of them that would match the <a href="http://toplas.acm.org/authors.cfm#acceptance-criteria"> acceptance criteria</a> and the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions">prior publication policy</a> of TOPLAS and, if so, handle the preparation of a <i>ESOP collected papers</i> issue of TOPLAS (see timetable below).</li> 
<li>must take part in the selection of the two ETAPS unifying speaker</li>
<li>must nominate papers for the EAPLS, EATCS and EASST Best Paper awards</li>
<li>must be present at the conference </li>
<li>must prepare a conference report to be presented in person at the ETAPS steering committee</li>
<li>must sit in the ETAPS SC for two years and in the ESOP SC for three years</li>
<li>Finally the PC Chair of ESOP X must sit in the committees of the ETAPS (X+1) "PhD dissertation award" and the ETAPS (X+3) "Test of the time award"</li>
</ul>
<p>
The PC Chair is advised to consult the following <a href="http://www.irif.fr/~gc/papers/pc-handbook.pdf">Handbook</a> where she/he can find useful information to organize the selection process. The PC Chair is also advised to add the PC Chair of the following year to the PC, even though she/he will be designated after the CFP are printed and distributed.
</p>
<p>
  PC submissions are welcome and will be handled by the program
  committee (there is no ERC). The PC chair must not submit.
  As all discussions will be electronic, the below policy should
  suffice to ensure a fair evaluation of PC submissions and avoid
  strong bias in favor or against them. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each PC submission will receive an extra review from an external reviewer.</li>
  <li>PC submissions are accepted only if:
  <ul>
    <li>they do not face strong opposition after the discussion and</li>
    <li>they are not involved in discussions of relative merits. That is,
    if there are more papers above the bar than can be accepted (ESOP
    has a limited number of paper slots determined by ETAPS) and if the
    group of relatively-weakest papers in this range
    includes PC submissions, then those get rejected first.
